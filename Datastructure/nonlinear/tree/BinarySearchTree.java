/**
 * Purpose:
 * Provides a generic Binary Search Tree (BST) implementation for storing,
 * organizing, and retrieving ordered data efficiently.
 *
 * This implementation maintains the binary search tree invariant whereby all
 * elements located in a node's left subtree are considered smaller than the
 * node itself, while all elements located in the right subtree are considered
 * greater according to the ComparableContent comparison contract.
 *
 * The tree supports insertion, search, removal, and traversal operations.
 * Duplicate elements are intentionally prohibited to guarantee deterministic
 * lookup behavior and to preserve a unique representation of stored data.
 *
 * Thread Safety:
 * This implementation is not thread-safe. Concurrent access and modification
 * require external synchronization.
 *
 * Owner:
 * P.B.R. - https://github.com/PBR208/

 * Version:
 * 1.0.0

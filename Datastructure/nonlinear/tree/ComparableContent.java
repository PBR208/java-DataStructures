/**
 * Purpose:
 * Defines the comparison contract required by objects that are intended to be
 * stored and managed within a BinarySearchTree implementation.
 *
 * This interface establishes a customizable ordering mechanism that allows
 * domain-specific objects to define how they are compared against one another.
 * The comparison methods are used by tree insertion, search, traversal, and
 * deletion operations to maintain the structural ordering guarantees of the
 * binary search tree.
 *
 * Implementing classes are responsible for providing a consistent and
 * transitive ordering relationship. Failure to implement these methods
 * correctly may result in invalid tree structures, incorrect search results,
 * or undefined traversal behavior.
